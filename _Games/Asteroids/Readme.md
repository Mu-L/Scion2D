## Scion Asteroids Template Project
----
This is a **template project** that can be loaded into the editor. The goal of this project was to try to showcase
as many **Scion2D** features as possible.
 
Some of the features included are:
* Scion Events are used in the lua scripts to trigger different events such as ship events to the hud and more.
* ```S2D_Class``` was used for all lua classes created.
* ```State``` and ```Statestack``` were used for the game, pause, title, and game over states.
* ```Timers```, ```Soundfx```, ```Music```.
* Gamepad Rumble when the ship gets hit.
* and more.
